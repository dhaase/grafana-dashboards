## What makes a good README?
The following is the recommended format for the READMEs appearing on Grafana.net.

**Important**: Screenshots are not part of the README, but are an essential part of presenting your plugin successfully. Screenshots are packaged within the /src directory of the plugin itself and specified within plugin.json; more information can be found [here](#).
